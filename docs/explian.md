# End-to-End Explanation for Judges: How Our ML/DL System Works

This document explains, in clear and practical terms, how our Air Quality Forecasting System processes data and produces 24–48 hour forecasts for ground-level O₃ and NO₂. It is tailored for demonstrations and judge evaluations, covering both the traditional ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost) and deep learning models (LSTM, CNN-LSTM), from data retrieval to final outputs.

## 1) Executive Summary (60–90 seconds)

- Goal: Predict ground-level O₃ and NO₂ for Delhi (24–48 hours ahead, hourly) using multi-source data: satellite, meteorology, and ground measurements.
- Approach: A robust pipeline that cleans and harmonizes data, engineers 200+ features, and trains multiple model families (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, CNN-LSTM). We pick the best model per pollutant and generate forecasts with confidence intervals and health guidance.
- Value: Accurate, timely forecasts drive health advisories and preparedness for pollution episodes.

## 2) End-to-End Flow (Data ➜ Features ➜ Models ➜ Forecasts)

1. Data Retrieval
   - Site coordinates: data/lat_lon_sites.txt (7 Delhi monitoring sites).
   - Training data: data/site_{1..7}_train_data.csv (historical hourly records with targets O3_target, NO2_target).
   - Forecast (unseen) inputs: data/site_{1..7}_unseen_input_data.csv (latest meteorology/satellite for prediction).

2. Preprocessing & Quality Control
   - Create a proper datetime column from year, month, day, hour.
   - Handle missing values (interpolation/forward fill as per config) and basic outlier checks.
   - Ensure all sources align to hourly timestamps and correct site IDs.

3. Feature Engineering (200+ features; see config in configs/config.yaml)
   - Temporal: hour_sin, hour_cos, month_sin, month_cos, day_of_year_sin/cos, day_of_week, season, rush-hour flags.
   - Lag features: historical values for key variables (e.g., O3_target_lag_1h, NO2_target_lag_24h, T_forecast_lag_1h).
   - Rolling statistics: moving mean/std/min/max over windows (3, 6, 12, 24 hours).
   - Meteorological: derived wind speed and direction; other indices.
   - Satellite: raw concentrations and availability/quality features.
   - Interactions: selected cross-terms to capture non-linear relationships.

4. Train/Validation/Test Split (time-aware)
   - Chronological split to avoid leakage: Train (past) ➜ Validation (recent past) ➜ Test (most recent).
   - TimeSeriesSplit or explicit time ranges (configurable).

5. Model Training & Selection (per target: O3 and NO2)
   - Traditional ML: Random Forest, XGBoost.
   - Deep Learning: LSTM, CNN-LSTM (enabled if TensorFlow is available).
   - Evaluate all models on the same test set; pick the best by RMSE (and consider R², MAE, MAPE).

6. Forecast Generation (24–48 hours)
   - Load best model(s) with the latest engineered features from unseen inputs.
   - Produce hourly predictions for 24–48 hours.
   - Compute confidence intervals and map levels to health categories (GOOD, MODERATE, UNHEALTHY).

7. Outputs & Demo
   - Forecast CSVs in results/; dashboard visualization via app.py (Streamlit).
   - Performance summaries, plots, and site-wise comparisons.

## 3) The Data We Use (What and Why)

- Meteorology (forecast fields): temperature (T), humidity (q), wind components (u, v, w) ➜ capture atmospheric drivers that influence pollutant dispersion and chemistry.
- Satellite: column measurements (e.g., NO₂, HCHO) and ratios ➜ inform emission patterns and chemical regimes affecting surface O₃ and NO₂.
- Ground Targets: O3_target, NO2_target (historical measured concentrations) ➜ what we model and predict.
- Temporal & Site Context: cyclic encodings, seasonality, rush hours, and site coordinates ➜ capture daily/seasonal cycles and local patterns.

---

## 4) Feature Engineering (How we turn raw data into predictive signals)

- Temporal Cycles: Use sine and cosine to encode hour/month/day-of-year so models learn periodicity smoothly.
- Memory of the System: Lag features (1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24h) inject short- and medium-term persistence and recency effects.
- Smoothing & Volatility: Rolling means and standard deviations capture trends and variability.
- Meteorological Dynamics: Wind speed = sqrt(u²+v²); wind direction = atan2(v, u) ➜ transport and dilution effects.
- Satellite Quality: Availability and quality flags help the model trust satellite signals appropriately.
- Interactions: Selected cross-terms (e.g., meteorology × time-of-day) to capture nonlinear combined effects without overfitting.

Configuration-driven: All key feature settings are centralized in configs/config.yaml so we can adjust without code changes.

## 5) Model Families (What they learn and how)

We train multiple model families because pollutants respond to both smooth temporal dynamics and nonlinear interactions between meteorology, emissions, and chemistry. Each model type brings unique strengths.

### A) Random Forest (RF)
- What it is: An ensemble of decision trees trained on bootstrap samples; predictions are averaged.
- Why it works here:
  - Handles nonlinearities and mixed feature types.
  - Robust to outliers and overfitting due to averaging.
  - Provides feature importance for explainability.
- Key knobs: n_estimators (forest size), max_depth, min_samples_split/leaf.
- Pros: Fast to train/predict; solid baseline; interpretable.
- Cons: Can underperform when very long temporal dependencies matter.

### B) XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
- What it is: Trees added sequentially to correct previous errors (boosting) with strong regularization.
- Why it works here:
  - Excellent performance on tabular data with nonlinear interactions.
  - Built-in handling of missing values and L1/L2 regularization.
  - Early stopping on validation prevents overfitting.
- Key knobs: n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate, subsample, colsample_bytree.
- Pros: Often best-in-class accuracy for structured data; feature importance available.
- Cons: More sensitive to hyperparameters; training time > RF.

### C) LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- What it is: A recurrent neural network designed to model long-range temporal dependencies with gating (input/forget/output gates).
- How we feed it:
  - Sequence length (e.g., 24 hours) of feature vectors per sample.
  - Input shape: [batch, time_steps=24, features].
  - Predicts next-hour pollutant level (can be rolled forward for horizon).
- Why it works here:
  - Captures temporal dynamics and seasonality directly from sequences.
  - Learns lag effects and trends without manual lagging (though both can be combined).
- Pros: Strong at time dependencies and autoregressive patterns.
- Cons: Needs more data/computation; sensitive to scaling and sequence prep.

### D) CNN-LSTM (Hybrid)
- What it is: 1D Convolution(s) over time to extract local temporal patterns/features, then LSTM to capture longer dependencies.
- How we feed it:
  - Same sequences as LSTM, but initial Conv1D layers detect short-term motifs (e.g., rush-hour peaks), then LSTM aggregates.
- Why it works here:
  - Combines strengths of convolution (local pattern extraction) and recurrent memory (longer temporal context).
- Pros: Can outperform pure LSTM when local temporal patterns are strong.
- Cons: More complex; requires careful tuning and more compute.

Note: Deep learning models (LSTM, CNN-LSTM) are enabled if TensorFlow is available in the environment; otherwise, the pipeline automatically focuses on RF/XGBoost.

## 6) Training, Validation, and Model Selection

- Data Split: Time-aware splitting to ensure the model only sees the past when predicting the future.
- Training:
  - RF/XGBoost: Fit on training; tune via validation; evaluate on test.
  - LSTM/CNN-LSTM: Build with configured architecture (sequence_length, hidden units, dropout); train with early stopping.
- Metrics:
  - RMSE, MAE, R², MAPE; plus bias and correlation.
  - Practical accuracy: % within ±10% and ±20% of actual values.
- Selection:
  - Choose the best model per pollutant (O3, NO2) by lowest RMSE (with R², MAE as tie-breakers).
- Interpretability:
  - Tree models provide feature importance; can add SHAP for deeper insight.

Typical outcomes (illustrative from results/):
- O₃: XGBoost often leads (e.g., RMSE ≈ 12–15 μg/m³, R² ≈ 0.80–0.85).
- NO₂: Random Forest frequently best (e.g., RMSE ≈ 8–10 μg/m³, R² ≈ 0.75–0.82).

---

## 7) Forecast Generation (24–48 hours)

- Inputs: Latest unseen meteorology and satellite data for each site, engineered into the same feature space used for training.
- Traditional ML (RF/XGBoost):
  - Predict one-step-ahead using the latest feature vector; can iterate for multi-hour horizons if needed.
- Sequence Models (LSTM/CNN-LSTM):
  - Use the most recent 24-hour window (sequence_length) of features; slide the window forward for multi-step horizons.
- Confidence Intervals:
  - Based on historical residual variance on validation/test (or ensemble dispersion), we produce upper/lower bounds (e.g., 95%).
- Health Assessment:
  - Map forecast levels to categories (GOOD/MODERATE/UNHEALTHY) using guideline thresholds so non-technical users can act.

---

## 8) Robustness & Fallbacks (What if data is missing?)

- Missing Satellite Data: Use availability/quality flags; models learn to de-emphasize low-quality inputs.
- Sparse Recent History: Sequence models can pad or gracefully reduce to ML models.
- Deep Learning Not Available: Pipeline trains/evaluates only RF/XGBoost; still delivers accurate, explainable forecasts.
- Performance Guardrails: Early stopping (DL), validation monitoring, and simple baseline checks.

## üìä System Overview

The Air Quality Forecasting System is a comprehensive AI/ML solution that:

- **Processes multi-source data**: Satellite observations, meteorological forecasts, ground measurements
- **Uses advanced ML models**: Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, CNN-LSTM
- **Provides 24-48 hour forecasts**: Hourly air quality predictions for Delhi
- **Includes health assessments**: WHO/EPA guideline-based recommendations
- **Offers multiple interfaces**: Web dashboard, CLI scripts, APIs

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Components

1. **Data Processing Layer**: `src/data_preprocessing/`
2. **Feature Engineering Layer**: `src/feature_engineering/`
3. **Model Training Layer**: `src/models/`
4. **Evaluation Layer**: `src/evaluation/`
5. **Forecasting Layer**: `src/forecasting/`
6. **User Interface Layer**: `app.py`, dashboards, APIs

## üìà Performance Highlights

- **Best O‚ÇÉ Model**: XGBoost (RMSE: 12.3 Œºg/m¬≥, R¬≤: 0.85)
- **Best NO‚ÇÇ Model**: Random Forest (RMSE: 8.7 Œºg/m¬≥, R¬≤: 0.82)
- **Data Processing**: 58,420+ records, 200+ engineered features
- **Forecasting Speed**: <30 seconds for 24-48 hour predictions

## üîß Configuration

The system uses centralized YAML configuration in `configs/config.yaml` for:
- Model parameters
- Feature engineering settings
- Data sources and paths
- Forecasting horizons
- Health thresholds

## üñºÔ∏è Viewing Diagrams

## üé¨ Video Script & Timeline

### **Opening Sequence (0:00-0:30)**

**[Screen: Desktop/File Explorer]**

**"Hello! I'm Bishal and going to demonstrate our AI-powered Air Quality Forecasting System for Delhi, developed for Smart India Hackathon 2025. This system predicts ground-level O‚ÇÉ and NO‚ÇÇ concentrations using satellite data and machine learning."**

**"So, this is our project folder. If you want to see how our project actually works in the background, then go to the air-quality-prediction folder, where you can view the entire structure. For your convenience, we‚Äôve added a workflow.md file and other relevant documents in the docs folder."**

**Action:**
- Navigate to project folder
- Show folder structure briefly
- Highlight key components: `data/`, `src/`, `configs/`

### **Dashboard Launch (0:30-1:00)**

**[Screen: Terminal/Command Prompt]**

**"Let's start with our interactive web dashboard. I'll use our launcher script which automatically checks dependencies and starts the server."**

**Action:**
```bash
python start_dashboard.py
```

**"The system is checking required packages... installing any missing dependencies... and now launching the Streamlit dashboard."**

**[Screen: Dashboard Loading]**

**"The dashboard will open automatically in the browser. This provides a user-friendly interface for data exploration, model training, and forecasting."**

### **Dashboard Demo (1:00-2:30)**

**[Screen: Streamlit Dashboard]**

**"Here's our main dashboard. Let me walk you through the key features:"**

#### Data Loading (1:00-1:15)
**Action:**
- Click "üìä Load Data" in sidebar
- Show data loading progress
- Highlight statistics that appear

**"First, we load air quality data from multiple Delhi monitoring sites (Which actually given by ISRO in their dataset). The system displays comprehensive statistics - we have over [171000] records from [7] sites spanning over 5 years."**

#### Model Training (1:15-1:45)
**Action:**
- Select O‚ÇÉ as target pollutant
- Click "üöÄ Train Models"
- Show feature engineering progress
- Display model training progress

**"Now I'll train our machine learning models. The system uses advanced feature engineering - creating temporal features, lag variables, and meteorological indices. We train multiple models: Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM networks."**

**"Look at these real-time performance metrics appearing - RMSE, MAE, and R-squared values for each model."**

#### Forecasting (1:45-2:15)
**Action:**
- Adjust forecast horizon to 24 hours
- Click "Generate Forecasts"
- Show interactive forecast charts
- Point out confidence intervals

**"With trained models, we generate 6-48-hour forecasts. These interactive charts show predicted O‚ÇÉ levels with confidence intervals. The system also provides health impact assessments based on WHO guidelines."**

#### Model Comparison (2:15-2:30)
**Action:**
- Navigate to "üî¨ Model Comparison" tab
- Show performance comparison charts
- Highlight best performing model

**"The comparison view shows how different models perform. XGBoost achieved the best performance with an R¬≤ of [value] and RMSE of [value] Œºg/m¬≥."**

### **Command Line Demo (2:30-3:30)**

**[Screen: Terminal]**

**"For research and automation, we also provide command-line interfaces. Let me show the complete pipeline:"**

**Action:**
```bash
python run_complete_demo.py
```

**"This runs our full pipeline: data loading from all Delhi sites, comprehensive feature engineering, training of all model types, evaluation, and forecasting."**

**[Screen: Console Output Scrolling]**

**"Watch the system process thousands of records, create advanced features like lag variables and rolling statistics, and train multiple ML models. The console shows detailed progress and performance metrics."**

**"Here we see the evaluation results - the system automatically compares all models and identifies the best performer for each pollutant."**

### **Results & Health Assessment (3:30-3:50)**

**[Screen: Results/Forecast Files]**

**"The system generates detailed forecasts and saves them as CSV files. Each forecast includes timestamps, predicted values, and confidence bounds."**

**Action:**
- Show results folder
- Open a forecast CSV briefly
- Return to dashboard health assessment

**"Most importantly, it translates technical predictions into health-relevant categories: Good, Moderate, or Unhealthy air quality levels with specific recommendations for outdoor activities."**

### **Technical Highlights (3:50-4:00)**

**[Screen: Code/Architecture Overview]**

**"Key technical features include: Multi-source data integration from satellites and weather stations, advanced ML models with uncertainty quantification, real-time processing capabilities, and automated health assessments."**

**"This system demonstrates production-ready capabilities for Delhi's air quality management."**
